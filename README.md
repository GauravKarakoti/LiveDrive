**Your permanent, programmable, and performant cloud drive.** LiveDrive offers a familiar cloud storage experience powered by the decentralized Filecoin network, combining hot storage performance with cold storage permanence.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Familiar UI:** Drag-and-drop upload, file management, and instant downloads.
*   **Verifiable Storage:** Cryptographic Proofs of Data Possession guarantee your files are always safe and available.
*   **Blazing-Fast Retrieval:** Files are served globally via the **FilCDN** network for CDN-like download speeds.
*   **Seamless Payments:** **Filecoin Pay** handles subscription billing via streaming payments, so you only pay for what you use.
*   **Truly Decentralized:** Your data is stored on the Filecoin network, not in a centralized silo. You own your data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

Want to run LiveDrive locally? Follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm
*   A MetaMask wallet with testnet FIL (get some from a Filecoin testnet faucet).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/livedrive.git
cd livedrive
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and update the values. You will need to get API keys/URLs for the Filecoin services you are integrating with (e.g., a FilCDN gateway, RPC endpoints).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the application.

Connect your wallet (configured for the correct Filecoin testnet) and start uploading!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
A high-level overview of how LiveDrive works:
1. Frontend (Next.js): The user interface built with React.
2. Synapse SDK: The bridge between the frontend and Filecoin. It handles:
3. File preparation (chunking, hashing).
  - Interaction with `WarmStorageService` smart contract to start storage deals.
  - Interaction with `FilecoinPay` contract to manage subscriptions.
  - Filecoin Blockchain: Records storage deals, payment streams, and proofs.
4. Filecoin Storage Providers (SPs): Store the user's file data.
5. FilCDN: Caches stored data and serves it to users via a global CDN for fast retrieval.
